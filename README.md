# 36.-Capitaland-AI-Hackathon-2025
The Knowledge Base Retrieval Assistant (prototype) Chatbot, our submission to for the Capitaland AI Hackathon 2025, aims to automate the process of searching and comparing internal 
domain knowledge of a company with external online sources (market), which can take a significant amount of time manually.

By solving this issue, it speeds up time efficiency, allowing employees to focus on more important parts of the project. At a business level, it allows more projects to be 
handled simulataneously, and allow for more latest and quality market research, boosting growth and keeping ahead in the market.

The nature of this 2-day hackathon is on GenAI.

(DISCLAIMER: The code for this prototype no longer works as it requires access to the API keys from the provided [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/) accounts by the 
hackathon, which are already removed.)

Last but not least, much much thanks to my teammates! We did not win, but I thought we came up with something worth remembering.

## Development Process and Technology Stack
During the hackathon, we were given internal data (of which I cannot share unfortunately) consisting of various documents such as,
- Design guidelines
- Quality procedures
- Project records

as well as a query (input) and response (output) test conditions (which may/may not include the properly retrieved internal domain knowledge document, if queried by the user) 
database to check if the chatbot is working.

With these data and test cases, we were asked to create a,  
```text
3-layer AI bot​ that enhances capabilities and boost productivity​:
Layer 1 - AI chatbot of Domain Knowledge database for easy info extraction. ​
Layer 2 - Link chatbot to OpenWeb/external data for ease of market research and benchmarking e.g. compare, in a table, our standards of car parking lot
size/layout/demarcation lines to that of the latest workspace building in the market, good LOA template.​
Layer 3 - Leveraging AI-generated insights to augment the continuous enhancement of the design guidelines, quality procedures and records
```
